# Delete Transaction Feature

## Overview

Added the ability to delete transaction records from both the HomeScreen and TransactionsScreen with a confirmation modal to prevent accidental deletions.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Delete Confirmation Modal

- **Location**: `/app/Components/Modals/DeleteConfirmationModal.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Shows a confirmation dialog before deleting any transaction
- **Features**:
  - Warning icon and clear messaging
  - Transaction preview showing type, category, amount
  - "This action cannot be undone" warning
  - Cancel and Delete action buttons
  - Color-coded transaction display (green for income, red for expense)

### 2. Enhanced TransactionItem Component

- **Updated Interface**: Added optional `onDelete` callback prop
- **Delete Button**: Small trash icon button appears when `onDelete` prop is provided
- **Visual Design**: Red-tinted button with proper spacing
- **Conditional Rendering**: Only shows delete button when delete functionality is enabled

### 3. HomeScreen Delete Functionality

- **Delete Button**: Appears on each transaction item in recent transactions
- **Balance Update**: Automatically adjusts balance when transaction is deleted:
  - Expense deletion: Adds amount back to balance
  - Income deletion: Subtracts amount from balance
- **State Management**: Removes deleted transaction from local state
- **Data Refresh**: Updates monthly statistics after deletion
- **Toast Notifications**: Success/error messages for user feedback

### 4. TransactionsScreen Delete Functionality

- **Delete Button**: Appears on each transaction item in monthly view
- **Monthly Data Refresh**: Updates the monthly summary cards after deletion
- **Filter Refresh**: Updates available years/months if last transaction in period is deleted
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediately reflects changes in the transaction list
- **Toast Notifications**: Success/error messages for user feedback

## User Flow

### From HomeScreen:

1. User taps the trash icon on any recent transaction
2. Confirmation modal appears showing transaction details
3. User confirms deletion by tapping "Delete" button
4. Transaction is removed from database and UI
5. Balance is automatically adjusted
6. Success toast notification is shown

### From TransactionsScreen:

1. User selects a month/year and views transactions
2. User taps the trash icon on any transaction
3. Confirmation modal appears showing transaction details
4. User confirms deletion by tapping "Delete" button
5. Transaction is removed from database and UI
6. Monthly summary cards are updated
7. Success toast notification is shown

## Technical Implementation

### Database Operations

- Uses SQLite `DELETE` statement with transaction ID
- Proper error handling for failed deletions
- Atomic operations to maintain data consistency

### State Management

- **Local State Updates**: Immediate UI updates for better UX
- **Balance Recalculation**: Automatic balance adjustment based on transaction type
- **Monthly Data Refresh**: Recalculates monthly totals after deletion
- **Filter Updates**: Updates available date filters if needed

### Error Handling

- Try-catch blocks around all database operations
- User-friendly error messages via Toast notifications
- Graceful fallback for failed operations
- Console logging for debugging

### UI/UX Considerations

- **Confirmation Required**: Prevents accidental deletions
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear transaction preview in confirmation modal
- **Consistent Design**: Matches app's design language
- **Accessible**: Clear labels and intuitive interactions
- **Responsive**: Works well on different screen sizes

## Files Modified

1. **New Files**:

   - `/app/Components/Modals/DeleteConfirmationModal.tsx`

2. **Modified Files**:
   - `/app/Components/TransactionItem.tsx` - Added delete button and onDelete prop
   - `/app/Screens/HomeScreen.tsx` - Added delete functionality with balance updates
   - `/app/Screens/TransactionsScreen.tsx` - Added delete functionality with data refresh

## Safety Features

1. **Confirmation Modal**: Requires explicit user confirmation
2. **Clear Warning**: "This action cannot be undone" message
3. **Transaction Preview**: Shows exactly what will be deleted
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of failed operations
5. **Data Validation**: Checks for valid transaction before deletion

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for this feature:

1. **Bulk Delete**: Allow selecting and deleting multiple transactions
2. **Undo Functionality**: Brief undo option after deletion
3. **Archive vs Delete**: Option to archive instead of permanently delete
4. **Delete Confirmation Settings**: User preference to skip confirmation for power users
5. **Audit Trail**: Log of deleted transactions for recovery purposes
